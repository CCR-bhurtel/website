# Advanced model definitions

## Composite primary keys

You can easily create a composite primary key by using the [`@PrimaryKey`](./decorators.mdx#primarykey) decorator on multiple attributes:

```ts
class Assignment extends Model<InferAttributes<Assignment>, InferCreationAttributes<Assignment>> {
  @Attribute(DataTypes.INTEGER)
  @PrimaryKey
  declare userId: number;

  @Attribute(DataTypes.INTEGER)
  @PrimaryKey
  declare taskId: number;
}
```

## Prevent creating a default PK attribute

By default, Sequelize automatically adds the primary key attribute `id` to every model when no primary key has been defined manually. 
To prevent this you can set the [`noPrimaryKey`](pathname:///api/v7/interfaces/ModelOptions.html#noPrimaryKey) option to true when defining the model.

```typescript
@Table({ noPrimaryKey: true })
export class User extends Model {}
```

If you want to prevent the addition of the default primary key for every model, you can also configure this option globally:

```js
class User extends Model {}

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  define: {
    noPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  models: [User],
});
```

## Caveat with minification

When defining a model, the name of the model will, by default, be the name of your class.

If you minify your code, it is possible that the class' name — and therefore its model name — will be changed by your minifier.
This can be an issue, as many systems use your modelName, from [sequelize.models](pathname:///api/v7/classes/Sequelize.html#models)
to [the name of the table associated to the model](./naming-strategies.mdx).

The solution to prevent this issue is to explicitly set the `modelName` option:

```typescript
// by specifying 'modelName' explicitely, the name of this model can be safely minified.
@Table({ modelName: 'User' })
export class User extends Model {}
```
