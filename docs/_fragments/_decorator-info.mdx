Sequelize currently only supports the legacy decorator proposal, which is what [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#decorators) supports.  
Support for the new proposal will be implemented once TypeScript supports it.

All decorators must be imported from `@sequelize/core/decorators-legacy`:

```ts
import { Attribute, Table } from '@sequelize/core/decorators-legacy';
```
